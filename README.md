This repository contains a collection of sketches and exercises I developed to practice with the **Arduino** platform, the **NI Multisim** software and **PLC ZEN-SOFT** software. 

The goal is to explore basic and intermediate functionalities, from blinking an LED to interfacing with sensors and actuators.
